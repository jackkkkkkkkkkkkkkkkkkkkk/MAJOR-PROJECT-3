# MAJOR PROJECT TERM 3 2023

## Description

 This repository contains <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JS</b> files for a website.  The purpose of the website is for me to learn how to write in <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and a little bit of <b>JS</b>.

 The site contains information about both Hardware <b>&</b> Software. (school assignment)

 <b>HTML</b> = Hyper-Text-Markup-Language  
 <b>CSS</b> = Cascading-Style-Sheet  
 <b>JS</b> = Javascript

 ## Software

 The only software I used to make this website is Visual Studio Code (to write the code) & Firefox (to view the visual representation of the code).  
 No AI tools were used in the writing of the code for this site, as I wanted to actually learn the languages stated before.  
 I hope you can trust this, as I would hate to not get full marks for this assignment, as I have spent so long on it! (it will also be nice to have on my resume :D)  

 ## Viewing the site

 To view the website you have two options:  
 
<b>1.</b> Visit https://example.com to view the site. (simplest)

<b>2.</b> Clone this repository and open `index.html` to view the site on your local machine. (not recommended, but if the host is down you would need to do this)
