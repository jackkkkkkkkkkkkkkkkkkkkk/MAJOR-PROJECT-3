     <p><big>Hardware</big> in a computer is the physical components that you can touch and see.
       It's like the building blocks that make up the whole computer system.
        These components work together to perform tasks and enable us to use our
         computers for various purposes. An example of a hardware component,
          is the central processing unit (<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a></b>). It carries out instructions and performs 
            calculations, allowing the computer to process data and run software.
             Memory, also known as random access memory (<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a></b>), is where the computer stores data that it's
               currently using. When you run programs or open files, they get temporarily stored 
               in the memory for quick access, which helps speed up the computer's performance.
                Additionally, the storage devices, such as hard disk drives
                 (<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive">HDDs</a></b>) or solid-state
                   drives (<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive">SSDs</a></b>), provide long-term storage for all your files, documents,
                    pictures, and software. They are like your computer's filing cabinet,
                     where you can save and retrieve data even when the computer is powered off.
                      Other essential hardware components include input devices like keyboards and mice,
                       which allow us to interact with the computer and give it commands.
                        Output devices such as monitors or printers show us the results of our work,
                         making it possible to see what we are doing.</p></div>
